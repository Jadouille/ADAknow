## In more detail...

### Question 1
Answers to question 1 will depend only on the Chicago Food Inspections dataset.

#### Data Summarization
- Research some of the work done on this dataset
- What are the fields of the datasets?
- Which fields are numerical, categorical and free fields?
- Do we have missing values?
- Do we have duplicate entries?
- Prepare some summary statistics for the data attributes
- Do some exploratory data plots to understand the data
- Is the data normalized?
- Does textual data have a consistent form?
- Are there correlated fields? Which ones? (Why?)

#### Data Wrangling
- Remove duplicates
- Handle missing data
- Transform data to prefered format
- Create new attributes if needed
- Normalize (and denormalize) as needed

#### Understand the data
For each sub-question of question 1:
- Identify fields in the data related to the question
- Form an educated hypothesis from exploring the data
- Propose a measure(s) to prove or falsify the hypothesis
- Carry experiments to get the required measures to prove or falisfy the hypothesis

#### Delivery for question 1
- What are the results?
- What can be concluded from these results?
- What is the best way to prove and deliver these results?
- What is the best visualization for the results communication?
- Write the report for part 1

### Questions 2 and 3
Integrate the income, ethnicity and reviews datasets.

#### Add datasets to answer questions 2 and 3
- Determine decisively which datasets are needed for questions 2 and 3
- Determine the format of the new (merged) dataset

#### Data Summarization
- Same as for question 1, now for the new dataset
- Determine which attributes in the new dataset are relevant

#### Data Wrangling
- Same as for question 1, now for the new dataset
- Propose a merging strategy or a strategy under which joint analysis on both datasets would be performed

#### Answer deeper questions:
- Same as part 1

#### Delivery
- Same as for question 1
