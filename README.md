# Title

# Abstract
We are shaped by what we eat. But we also shape where we eat.  In this project, we investigate the food scene in Chicago. Are chefs ready to trade high-quality, fresh ingredients for cheaper stale ones? Are there places and times where food conservation has a subjective meaning? Are large-scale franchises such as McDonald’s and Starbucks under the same level of scrutiny as normal restaurants despite the economic interests at play? 

We propose taking a structured look at Chicago’s food inspection scene and everything happening behind the curtain – starting with food violations and usual risk, progressing beyond year seasons and temperatures, reaching all the way down to location and block-level wealth and ethnicity.

In order to achieve this, we will dive into the Chicago Food Inspection as well as the Wealth Distribution Dataset from the Chicago City Data Portal, the Voting Age Census for Ethnicities from the US government website, and the Google Reviews dataset.

# Research questions
1. How fair are inspections?
	1. Which type of restaurants is being controlled the most? And which type of restaurant tend to pass the test the most? 
	2. What is the relationship between "at risk" and failing to pass the inspection?
	3. Do the inspection patterns change for large chain restaurants [from Starbucks and McDonald's] compared to smaller independent ones? 

2. How much do violations correlate with external events?
	1. How are violations/failed inspections sensitive to permanent external factors such as neighbourhood, type of establishments?
	2. How do violations/failed inspections correlate with temporary factors such as season, and time of the year? That is, for a given area, are violations more or less regular, or are they susceptible to external factors, such as temperature?

3. Do violations and inspections reflect deeper biases?
	1. Are restaurants that failed the inspection clustered in certain areas of the city? Similarly, are restaurants that pass the test located in certain parts of the city?
	2. How does the number of violations and inspections correspond with the (perceived) wealthiness of each neighborhood of Chicago?
	3. Do poorer parts of Chicago receive more inspections and/or violations? Is there any correlation with the prevalent ethnicity in these areas?
	4. Is there a relationship between the inspections and restaurants' popularity on Google Local Review?
