Can the reviews posted on online services allow us to discover whether a businesses is failing or passing the inspections in Chicago? In this section, we are going to analyze if there is a relationship between the review rates on Google Local (Google Maps) and their corresponding inspections.

We have merged the Heath Inspection with Google's Local dataset, extracted from the  <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html">Recommender Systems Dataset</a> by Julian McAuley, professor at the University of California, San Diego. After filtering the data, obtaining only the reviews businesses in Chicago and merging them with our dataset, we obtain around 1600 unique businesses for which we have reviews. 

We then try to find relationships between the businesses average review rate and their probability of passing an inspections (calculated from the Health Inspection Dataset), as well as the number of reviews. 

To analyze the possible relationships, we study several correlations. All of them yield irrelevant correlations between the variables considered. The following table shows highest correlation (Spearman) obtained:

In addition, we also inspect the variables visually. As expected, the variables do not seem to have a significant correlation. The following plot proves this point.

Thus, we cannot find a connection between Google Local reviews and the posibility of passing or failing an inspection. Both visual inspection and numeric values have failed to find any relation. 

Then, we can say the number rating of a business on Google does not seem to be correlated with its number of failed/passed inpspections. Does this mean that users do not really care about the health conditions of a businesses where they go? Probably they do not have the chance to go behind the scene and therefore they cannot know the true conditions of the businesses. 

In this analysis, we do need to highlight that the number of overlapping businesses between the Google dataset and Health Inspection is small (~1600), with a heavy-tailed distribution on the number of reviews. Therefore, we deduce that a dataset of reviews with more up-to-date reviews and more businneses in both datasets could yield different results.
