# We are were we eat
We are shaped by what we eat. But we also shape where we eat. Are chefs ready to trade high-quality, fresh ingredients for cheaper stale ones? Are there places and times where food conservation has a subjective meaning? Are large-scale franchises such as McDonald’s and Starbucks under the same level of scrutiny as normal restaurants despite the economic interests at play?
